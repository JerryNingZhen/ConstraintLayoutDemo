## Mastering Constraint Layout

Different examples of how to use ConstraintLayout for different purposes. 
- Covering Circular Constraints
- Barriers, Guidelines, Constraints etc
- ImageFilterView
- ConstraintLayoutStates

The purpose of these layouts is to showcase how to use ConstraintLayout to solve a complex layout.

The app has no functionality.

This is a demo application that is used in conjunction with my "Mastering Android Layouts" workshop.
This was presented with these slides https://speakerdeck.com/riggaroo/mastering-android-layouts-workshop-slides
